# Speaker Recognition using Pitch, MFCC and KNN classifier
This project uses machine learning approach to recognise speaker based on features extracted from recorded speech. Initial idea was taken from an [MathWorks article] (https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/examples/speaker-identification-using-pitch-and-mfcc.html) where they demonstrated the method using different MATLAB toolboxes, I avoided using those toolbox and tried to implement most of the algorithms from scratch.
